# Experiences with HOOKS ⚓️
See in action at [React Hooks Playground](https://modest-snyder-cafd27.netlify.com/)

## What is hooks

- Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and life cycle features from function components
- More information at [React Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Why

- **Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy**.
- Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data
- Code is cleaner.

## Demo

1. Toggler
2. Simple Form
3. Clicker (with `useEffect()`)
4. Fetch API at [https://swapi.co](https://swapi.co)
